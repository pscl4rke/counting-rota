Generate suggestions for assigning volunteers into empty slots
on a rota.

These are some of the goals of the rotas it generates:

* No clashes with unavailability!
* Evenly spread among people
* Not serving too many times in a row
* Not always putting the same people together
* Takes into account service so far on previous rotas

We're not yet at that point!
